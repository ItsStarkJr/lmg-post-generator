      Castle wall rules: Draw a non-intersecting loop through the centers of
      some cells. The loop may not enter outlined cells or cells containing
      clues. White squares must lie inside the loop, while black squares must
      lie outside the loop. Grey cells may either be inside or outside the loop.
      A number represents the sum of the lengths of loop segments in the
      indicated direction.

    <li style="max-width: none">
      Directions and values of all castle wall clues have to be determined, if
      not given. Clues see their amount of loop segments in at least one
      direction.

      A clue outside a row gives the sum of the digits on the first horizontal
      segment passing through its row (including the cells which it turns),
      likewise for columns and vertical segments.
